			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Learning about scalable systems</b>. It's an exciting time for cloud related technolgies. I'm constantly working to learn and improve my self and put them to real use in my projects(personal as well as professional)
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Tooling</b>. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality
          devices. I like to modify existing kits to improve speed, and add instrumentation.
