                    <p>This book serves as my go-to reference guide, which I often pick up and read. I also enjoy Martin Kleppmann's insightful videos on YouTube to complement the material. I'm working on quick reference notes soon, focusing on key topics like transactions across distributed systems, replication, and consensus algorithms.</p>
